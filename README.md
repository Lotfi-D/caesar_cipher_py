# ​ Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** encryption algorithm in Python.  
You can encode and decode messages by shifting letters of the alphabet.

---

## ​ Features
- Encrypt a message with a custom shift
- Decrypt a message with the same shift
- Handles wrap-around for letters (e.g., `z` shifted by 2 → `b`)
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (spaces, numbers, punctuation)
- Interactive loop: run multiple times without restarting the program

---

## ​​ How to Run
Clone the repository and run the script in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lotfi-D/caesar_cipher_py.git
cd caesar_cipher_py
python caesar_cipher.py
